\chapter{Source Debugging Information format}
This chapter presents the format about source debugging information used by the
debugger. The format closely represents the JSON~\cite{json} format. It is made
up of debugging information entries (DIEs) and their attributes. Each DIE has a
tag that identifies its purpose. The tag is part of the name. Additionaly, each
DIE can have attributes, which describe some property of the DIE. Finally, a
DIE can have an arbitrary many children DIEs. The general grammar for DIE:
\begin{lstlisting}
DIE = "DIE_", tag "{" ({DIE | Attr}  "," "}"
Attr = "ATTR_", attr_name, ":", AttrValue
\end{lstlisting}

A concrete example of debugging information:
\begin{lstlisting}
DIE_compilation_unit: {
DIE_function: {
  ATTR_name: main,
  ATTR_begin_addr: 0,
  ATTR_end_addr: 8,
  DIE_scope: {
    ATTR_begin_addr: 0,
    ATTR_end_addr: 8, 
    DIE_variable: {
      ATTR_name: d,
      ATTR_type: double,
      ATTR_location: `BASE_REG_OFFSET -2`,
    },
  },
},
}
\end{lstlisting}

\section{Tags}
The allowed value of attributes changes based on the DIE they are in. We will
describe each DIE tag and the allowed attributes.
