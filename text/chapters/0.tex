\chapter{Introduction}
Todays world is practically run by a computers. They are everywhere, from our wrists to our cars.
All of these computers car run some sort of programs. These programs define what the computer does.
Programs are executed by a processor, an integral part of every computer. Processors have several instructions, which can be executed, and can also read and write to either memory or a registers. However, processors can only understand machine code. For example, very simple machine code instruction is \mintinline{0100 0001}. This instruction increases value by one of register ECX. Real programs are made of thousands and thousands such instructions. Making sense of these programs for human is very, very difficult. But, if we know that certain pattern corresponds to certain instruction, we could at the very least make it readable for humans.
